# Active Context - ClickUp MCP Server

## Current Focus: Missing Tool and Resource Descriptions

### Issue Identification
During testing with the MCP Test Client, we discovered that while all functionality is properly implemented, we are missing critical documentation:

1. Tool Documentation Gaps:
- All registered tools lack descriptions in the test output
- Affects all tool categories:
  * Workspace and Authentication tools
  * Space management tools
  * Folder operations
  * List management
  * Task operations
  * Document handling
  * Checklist functionality
  * Comment system

2. Resource Documentation Gaps:
- Resources and templates lack descriptive context
- Affects:
  * Direct resources (e.g., example-task, example-doc)
  * Resource templates
  * URI patterns are correct but purpose is unclear

### Current State
- Server: Operational and responding correctly
- Tools: All registered and functional
- Resources: Properly structured
- Parameters: Schemas defined correctly
- Core Functionality: Working as expected

### Required Improvements
1. Tool Descriptions:
- Add descriptions to all tool registrations in src/tools/*
- Document purpose, usage, and expected outcomes
- Include any relevant limitations or requirements

2. Resource Documentation:
- Add descriptions to all resource definitions
- Document the purpose of each resource type
- Clarify the meaning of URI parameters
- Explain relationships between resources

### Next Steps
1. Update tool registration code to include descriptions
2. Add documentation to resource definitions
3. Verify improvements with MCP Test Client
4. Update testing documentation as needed

### Impact
Proper documentation is critical for:
- AI assistant understanding and usage
- Developer onboarding
- System maintainability
- Integration testing
- User experience

### Testing Verification
Use MCP Test Client to verify improvements:
```powershell
dotnet run --project D:/dev/ai/my-mcp-servers/mcp-test-client/MCPTestClient/src/MCPTestClient.CLI -- list-all --server clickup
```
