## Adding New Features

### Adding New ClickUp API Functionality

1. **Understand the ClickUp API**: Review the [ClickUp API documentation](https://clickup.com/api) for the feature you want to add.

2. **Implement the API Client**:
   - Add the necessary methods to the appropriate client file in `src/clickup-client/`
   - Follow the existing patterns for error handling and response formatting

3. **Create MCP Tools**:
   - Add tool implementations in the appropriate file in `src/tools/`
   - Use Zod for input validation
   - Follow the existing error handling patterns

4. **Create MCP Resources** (if applicable):
   - Add resource implementations in the appropriate file in `src/resources/`
   - Define clear URI templates for accessing the resources

5. **Register Tools and Resources**:
   - Make sure your tools and resources are registered in the setup functions

6. **Update Documentation**:
   - Add documentation for your new tools and resources in the README.md

### Example: Adding a New Tool

```typescript
// In src/tools/your-feature-tools.ts
server.tool(
  'your_new_tool',
  {
    param1: z.string().describe('Description of param1'),
    param2: z.number().optional().describe('Description of param2')
  },
  async ({ param1, param2 }) => {
    try {
      const result = await yourFeatureClient.yourMethod(param1, param2);
      return {
        content: [{ type: 'text', text: JSON.stringify(result, null, 2) }]
      };
    } catch (error: any) {
      console.error('Error in your_new_tool:', error);
      return {
        content: [{ type: 'text', text: `Error: ${error.message}` }],
        isError: true
      };
    }
  }
