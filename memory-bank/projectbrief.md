# ClickUp MCP Server Project Brief

## Project Overview
An MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that provides a standardized interface for AI assistants to interact with the ClickUp API, enabling seamless integration between AI systems and ClickUp's project management platform.

## Core Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. API Integration
   - Full integration with ClickUp's API
   - Support for all major ClickUp entities (workspaces, spaces, folders, lists, tasks, docs, comments)
   - Authentication via API tokens and OAuth

2. MCP Compliance
   - Implementation using MCP TypeScript SDK
   - Exposure of ClickUp functionality through standardized MCP tools
   - Resource-based access to ClickUp data
   - Proper error handling and validation

3. Security
   - Secure handling of API tokens
   - Proper authentication flow
   - Protection of sensitive data

### Technical Requirements
1. Architecture
   - Modular design with separate clients for different ClickUp entities
   - Clear separation of concerns (API clients, tools, resources)
   - TypeScript implementation with strong typing

2. Documentation
   - Comprehensive tool descriptions
   - Clear resource documentation
   - Well-documented URI patterns
   - Usage examples and guides

3. Testing
   - Thorough testing with MCP Test Client
   - Verification of all tools and resources
   - Error handling validation

## Project Goals
1. Enable AI assistants to:
   - Access ClickUp data through standardized interfaces
   - Perform ClickUp operations without direct API knowledge
   - Handle complex ClickUp workflows efficiently

2. Provide:
   - Reliable and stable ClickUp integration
   - Clear documentation for AI understanding
   - Robust error handling and recovery

3. Ensure:
   - High-quality code with TypeScript
   - Comprehensive testing coverage
   - Maintainable and extensible architecture

## Success Criteria
1. Technical
   - All tools properly documented and functional
   - All resources correctly exposed with descriptions
   - Clean test results from MCP Test Client
   - Proper error handling for all operations

2. Integration
   - Successful ClickUp API integration
   - Proper authentication flows
   - Reliable data access and manipulation

3. Documentation
   - Clear tool and resource descriptions
   - Well-documented usage patterns
   - Comprehensive testing guide

## Constraints
1. Technical
   - Must use MCP TypeScript SDK
   - Must maintain ClickUp API compatibility
   - Must handle rate limiting

2. Security
   - Must protect API tokens
   - Must validate all inputs
   - Must handle errors gracefully

3. Documentation
   - Must provide clear descriptions for AI understanding
   - Must document all tools and resources
   - Must maintain testing documentation

## Timeline
